## Summary

Experienced software engineer with an 12-year track record of designing and building robust applications. My expertise spans a wide array of technologies, including Java (versions 8 to 17), and a variety of frameworks such as Spring, JSF, Struts, and more recently, Quarkus. I've also excelled in the world of web development, transitioning from AngularJS to Angular 2+ and employing Ionic for Hybrid mobile app creation.

In the realm of DevOps, I'm a fervent advocate for automation, consistently implementing CI/CD practices to elevate project efficiency. My toolkit includes Gitlab CI, Jenkins, Shell Scripting, Docker, and Kubernetes.

My passion extends to documentation, where I consider code and diagrams as vital forms of communication. My favorite tools for this purpose are Markdown and the C4 model, ensuring clarity and coherence in project documentation.
